Basket API

Vertical slice architecture is applied on the Microservice Basket API. Just like Catalog API the project is organized around specific features or use cases rather than technical concerns. Features are implemented across all layers of the service (from UI to database). Features are defined on `Basket` folder where each unique pathname can be defined as a feature (for example get or store basket).
