Catalog API

Vertical slice architecture is applied on the Microservice Catalog API. That being said that the project is organized around specific features or use cases rather than technical concerns. Features are implemented across all layers of the service (from UI to database). Features are defined on `Products` folder where each unique pathname can be defined as a feature (for example get product by unique id or create a new product).
